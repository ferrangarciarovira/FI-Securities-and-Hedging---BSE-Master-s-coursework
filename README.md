# FI Securities and Hedging – BSE Coursework

This repository contains code and materials from the *Fixed Income Securities and Hedging* course, part of the Master's in Financial Economics at the Barcelona School of Economics (BSE). I completed this course during my final year of undergraduate studies as part of an advanced track.

The course is taught by Prof. Eulàlia Nualart and provides a rigorous and quantitative approach to pricing and hedging fixed income instruments. Topics include arbitrage pricing, duration and convexity, empirical hedging, and modeling of the term structure of interest rates.

## Course Overview
The course covers key frameworks and tools used in fixed income markets:
- Arbitrage pricing and bond valuation
- Duration and convexity analysis
- Yield curve construction and term structure modeling
- Empirical hedging strategies using interest rate derivatives (forwards, futures, swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions)

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with implementations and analysis
- `excel/`: Excel sheets with pricing models and calculations
- `data/`: Datasets used in coursework (if applicable)
- `reports/` – Summaries or reports developed for the course
- `problem_sets/` – Full solutions to course assignments
