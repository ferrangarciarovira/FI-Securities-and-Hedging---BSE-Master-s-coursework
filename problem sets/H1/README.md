# Homework 1 

This folder contains my full solution to Homework 1.

## Exercises

1. **Bond Pricing**: Calculate theoretical bond prices using Bloomberg yields and compare with market prices. Discuss discrepancies due to factors like accrued interest and conventions.

2. **Real vs Nominal Yields**: Compare Treasury yields with TIPS to visualize the inflation premium.

3. **Discount Curve**: Apply bootstrapping on short-maturity Treasury bonds to extract the discount curve.

4. **Duration and Convexity**: Compute modified duration and convexity for selected bonds and estimate the price impact of a 0.1% yield shift.

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)

## Notes
All bonds assumed to have $100 face value and semi-annual coupons. Yields are annualized and compounded semi-annually.
